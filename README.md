Hi, I'm Julia! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst who transforms data into valuable insights and solutions.

I extract data from databases and other sources (SQL: CTEs, subqueries, window functions). 

I perform Data Preparation: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Feature Engineering and Normalization.

I create informative dashboards based on requirements using Python, Power BI and Redash. My research includes correlation analysis, cohort analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis and RFM analysis.

I calculate business, marketing and product metrics such as DAU, MAU, ARPU, LTV, CR, Retention and more. I identify patterns, formulate and test hypotheses and interpret A/B test results.

For modeling, I train classification and regression models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, MLP Classifier) and assess model quality using metrics like MAE, MSE, accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score, along with cross-validation.

This portfolio showcases my skills, projects and progress in data analysis. I hope it helps you assess my abilities in programming, data analysis, and working with SQL or simply makes for an interesting view.
